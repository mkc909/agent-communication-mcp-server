## Branch Strategy

We recommend the following branch strategy for this project:

1. **main**: Production-ready code. All code in this branch should be stable and deployable.
2. **develop**: Integration branch for feature development. Features are merged here before being promoted to main.
3. **feature/\***: Feature branches for specific features or components (e.g., `feature/agent-registry`, `feature/message-bus`).
4. **bugfix/\***: Branches for bug fixes.
5. **release/\***: Release branches for preparing releases.

## GitHub Actions Workflow Examples

Here are some GitHub Actions workflow examples that can be set up for this project:

### CI Workflow

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
```

### Deployment Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          # Add deployment steps here
          # This could be deploying to a server, cloud service, etc.
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**: Create a branch from `develop` for your feature or bug fix.
2. **Implement Changes**: Make your changes in the feature branch.
3. **Write Tests**: Add tests for your changes.
4. **Update Documentation**: Update documentation as needed.
5. **Create Pull Request**: Create a pull request to merge your changes into `develop`.
6. **Code Review**: Request code review from team members.
7. **Address Feedback**: Address any feedback from the code review.
8. **Merge**: Once approved, merge the pull request into `develop`.

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive information like API keys or passwords. Use environment variables and the `.env` file (which should be in `.gitignore`).
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`.
3. **Code Scanning**: Consider setting up GitHub's code scanning to identify security vulnerabilities.
4. **Access Control**: Manage repository access carefully, following the principle of least privilege.

## Development Workflow Tips

1. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages. Follow a convention like:
   ```
   feat: Add agent registration functionality
   fix: Resolve message bus connection issue
   docs: Update API documentation
   test: Add tests for task management
   ```

2. **Issue Tracking**: Link commits and pull requests to issues using keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456".

3. **Code Reviews**: Be thorough in code reviews. Look for:
   - Code quality and style
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation
   - Security concerns
   - Performance implications

4. **Continuous Integration**: Make use of CI to catch issues early.

## MCP Server Specific Considerations

1. **API Versioning**: Consider versioning the MCP server API to allow for future changes without breaking existing clients.

2. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the MCP server, including:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

3. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for:
   - API endpoints
   - Data models
   - Configuration options
   - Deployment procedures

4. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for the MCP server to track:
   - Performance metrics
   - Error rates
   - Resource usage

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Phase 1: Core MCP Server Development**
   - Implement Agent Registry component (Issue #6)
   - Implement Message Bus component (Issue #7)
   - Implement Task Management component
   - Implement Context Sharing component

2. **Phase 2: GitHub Integration**
   - Implement GitHub authentication
   - Implement Issue and PR management
   - Implement Project board integration
   - Implement Comment system

3. **Phase 3: PlanetScale Integration**
   - Set up PlanetScale database
   - Implement schema and migrations
   - Optimize queries and connection pooling
   - Set up backup and recovery procedures

4. **Phase 4: Integration and Testing**
   - Integrate all components
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Set up logging and monitoring
   - Conduct thorough testing

## Conclusion

This document provides a starting point for System Administrators working on the Cross-System Agent Communication MCP Server project. By following these guidelines and best practices, you can effectively manage the project using GitHub and ensure its successful implementation.
